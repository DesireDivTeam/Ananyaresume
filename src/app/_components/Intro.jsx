        <p className='text-justify font-extralight'>I was born in Mumbai and was fortunate to be raised in different cities across India (North and Western India) . With its rich and diverse culture , every new place in India offers something new to learn and grow. I imbibed this  during my growing years and it broadened my thinking process and environmental consciousness . On one hand my mind and soul was uplifted with  good mix of music playing in my house and on the other hand I was also inspired academically especially with numbers. I am raised in a close knitted loving family  with my grandparents and my mother being passionate educators in Sciences  and Language. These traits of my family members have led to my all round development and life experiences. I excelled in Senior Secondary examination with top percentile performance along with keen interest in Dance. I continued this passion during B Tech in Computer Science from Delhi Technological University (DTU) â€“ with good mix of performance in academics, research papers, documentary & leading extra curricular activities.  </p>
