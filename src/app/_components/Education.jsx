              Excelled in academics in my school time and was awarded a Blue Badge
              Holder for consistent performance. Secured 95.6% in Class X boards
              with 100/100 in the subject Information and Technology.
              Additionally, I got 96% in Class XII boards.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was always in the top percentile of my class and always eager to
              learn and explore. I am extremely hardworking and believe in a
              can-do attitude.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am perseverant and dedicated towards my goal and will put my
              heart and soul into achieving my goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not afraid of making mistakes, when I make a mistake, I will
              learn from it and try not to repeat it. The best way for
              self-growth and self-learning is by making mistakes and learning
              from them.
