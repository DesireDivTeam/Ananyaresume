          I have worked as an intern for a month at Haleon (London and
          Bangalore) company. Over there, I explored the field of Business
          Intelligence Data Analytics. I learnt about PowerBI and made various
          reports using PowerBI. I also worked on various projects during my
          time there and developed an understanding of how to connect and
          visualise different data sources in a user-friendly way and effective
          decision-making using PowerBI-led data insights.
