            Apart from my academia, I love social work and volunteering. I
            believe in the motto –&apos;&apos;Service before Self&apos;&apos;. I
            believe in giving back to society in whatever ways I can to the less
            fortunate. It breaks my heart that in my country, basic human
            rights, like the Right to Education, the Right to be free from
            Exploitation, etc, aren&apos;t given to underprivileged people.
            Coming from a secure and healthy place, I feel that I should be able
            to help these people especially women and children who are often
            left unnoticed.

            I have been part of a crowdfunding campaign where the goal was to
            raise Rs 15000, for an underprivileged girl. I managed to raise Rs
            31000 for that girl and this money was able to cover her education
            expenses, her food and her uniform expenses. Nothing made me happier
            than seeing the look of joy in her eyes.

            In my school, a program called &apos;&apos;Shiksha
            Kendra&apos;&apos; used to run after school hours for
            underprivileged students. I volunteered to teach them basic maths
            and Science at least 2-3 times as well as donated some of my clothes
            and books to them.

            In the 4th Semester of my college, I took an elective named
            “Extension and Outreach”, where I worked on raising awareness about
            menstrual hygiene among poor women and girls. I visited a few NGOs
            and talked about the importance of menstrual hygiene, made posters
            and conducted a few activities so that the women and girls could
            interact. I talked about the myths and taboos of menstruation, the
            importance of sanitary napkins, the importance of hygiene and many
            more.(Received O grade in this, highest)

            Currently, I am also a mentor of a “Girls Grow Program”. In this
            program, our main focus is on secondary and senior school girls. Our
            main aim is to motivate these girls in the field of STEM. Girls are
            discouraged from pursuing STEM, or they don&apos;t have the
            right/adequate guidance to form the required decision. So we conduct
            sessions for these girls about various topics like what STEM is,
            what options they have in STEM, the resources for the STEM fields,
            women in STEM, colleges, Career options in STEM field and much more.

            I have been mentoring girls from a few schools and providing them
            with the necessary guidance. I have helped them with their questions
            related to the Science and Technology Field, always motivating them
            to study and research more before making a decision and have also
            provided them with the necessary materials and resources.
