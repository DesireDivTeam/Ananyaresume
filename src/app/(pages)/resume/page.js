            -In my JEE examination, I was among the top 1.75 percentile and have
            also cleared JEE Advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I am pursuing a B-tech in Computer Science from the prestigious
            Delhi Technological University. Computer Science has given me
            exposure to various fields, such as data structures and algorithms,
            database management systems, operating systems, computer
            organization and architecture, and many more.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I have gained excellence in Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) and
            Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA). I have solved over 379
            Questions on Leetcode related to DSA and 663 Questions on Code
            Studios related to DSA and Front-End Web Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I have specialized in C, C++ and have DSA and OOPS in C++. I have
            also made a Snakes and Ladder Project in C language as well using
            data structures such as graphs, queues, 2D Arrays and 1D arrays.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I have completed an Udemy course in Python, wherein I learned the
            basics of Python and worked with various libraries such as Selenium,
            Beautiful Soup, Flask, Numpy, Pandas and many more. In this course,
            I have done many projects as well, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, snakes and
            Ladder, and web scraper for movie titles, to name a few.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Apart from Computer Science, I have always been really interested
            in the subject of mathematics. Maths has always been one of my
            strong subjects. So, whenever a bit of technology is used in
            Mathematics, that would intrigue me.

            Classical Dance form and have passed two stages of the Kathak dance
            exam. I am also a part of an Indian Dance Society Club Nrityangana
            and have performed in various events of the college and have
            represented my college for the same in IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay and

            -Currently, I am Public Relation Head and member of the senior
            council of Nrityangana (DTU dance club). I currently perform as well
            manage additional responsibilities regarding funds, events and files

          <p>
            -I have also been part of the &apos;&apos;Desh Ke Mentor&apos;&apos;
            Programme, a government-initiated program Where-in we were assigned
            four mentees. I used to check up on them every week and provide them
            tips regarding time management, how to study their career options,
            and much more in detail. I always encouraged them to ask questions,
            no matter how irrelevant it seemed to them. Doing this ensured that
            they became more confident and less hesitant.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I have also taken part in tech events of my college like VIHAAN and
            INVICTUS. In INVICTUS, I was a part of the PR and Corporate
            department. I spread awareness about the programs by making posters
            through social media, going from classroom to classroom and talking
            about the events. I also helped in making the databases of potential
            sponsors and did cold mailing as well, for procuring deals.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I helped in forming questions for a few events for INVICTUS, like
            guestimates, Matheletics (Maths quiz event), as well as rules and
            was also a part of the team that was conducting the events. I helped
            ensure fair and smooth conduct for all these events and graciously
            handled any problem that occurred during the conduction.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I was in the PR department for VIHAAN(hackathon) wherein I spread
            awareness about the event, almost the same as INVICTUS work.
          </p>
          <p>
            -My college has given me good exposure to public speaking. I have
            improved my speaking skills and can, without hesitation, speak to
            any number of people about a topic. I am also quick on my feet, I
            can respond to any sudden change or event graciously and also can
            decide the same.
